# A project to predict character survival in the world of Westeros
## Work plan:
- Part 1. Data analysis and preprocessing:
- Data preprocessing (the dataset had many missing values, so we had to process them)
- Creation of new features (to simplify the model, some old features were replaced with new ones)
- Analysis of the influence of features on the target variable (the influence of features on the target variable was tested using graphs)
- Converting categorical features to numerical ones (we converted previously unprocessed categorical features using one-hot coding)
- Part 2. Model training:
- LogisticRegression
- RandomForestClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- CatBoostClassifier
- Part 3. Model quality assessment
- Quality assessment
- Training on all available data
- Transforming test data
- Prediction on the best model and submitting.
